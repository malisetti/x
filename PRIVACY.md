You are safe with me. I log the following http headers from any request

* User-Agent
* Cf-Ipcountry
* Accept
* Cf-Connecting-Ip
* X-Forwarded-For

You can check the logging middleware code at server/middlewares.go

I dont share the above information with anyone and I purge the logs frequently without taking any backups.
