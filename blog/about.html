            We live on a planet that's <span style="color: blue">blue</span> and <span style="color: green">green</span>, with so many things still unseen.
            Somehow we are here, able to communicate in an instant leaving distance out of equation.
            Everyone has lot of processing speed and connectivity in their hands.
            Future technology will step up this and enable individuals connect to internet via their minds.
            One can consume information, communicate with just brain(thoughts). How can you cope up with this non stop flow of information ?
            Is there a place on internet where you can look at to get the best of the news not each minute but a more reasonable duration like 8hrs ?
